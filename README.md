## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    
    git clone ([https://github.com/Balaji/BallotX.git](https://github.com/Balaji849/BallotX-Secure-Voting-System-React.js-Hardhat-MetaMask-))
    ```bash
    cd BallotX
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## 🖥️ Running the Server

Follow these specific commands to compile contracts and start the local blockchain network.

### 1. Compile Smart Contracts
Force compile the contracts to generate the necessary artifacts.
```bash
npx hardhat compile --force
```
### 2. Start the Local Mode
Navigate to the voting app directory and start the Hardhat node.
```bash
cd voting-app
npx hardhat node
```
Note: Keep this terminal window open to keep the local network running.

### 3.Deploy Contracts
Open a new terminal, return to the project root, and deploy the scripts to localhost.
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts\deploy.js --network localhost
```
## 🦊 Configuration
To interact with the application, configure your MetaMask wallet to connect to the local development network.

| Setting | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Network Name** | `Localhost 8545` |
| **RPC URL** | `http://127.0.0.1:8545/` |
| **Chain ID** | `31337` |
| **Currency Symbol** | `ETH` |

### 🔑 How to Login
Since this is a local test environment, you do not need a specific password. Instead, you must **import a test account**:

1.  Check the terminal where `npx hardhat node` is running.
2.  Copy one of the **Private Keys** listed (e.g., `0xac09...`).
3.  Open MetaMask → Click on the **Account Icon** → Select **Import Account**.
4.  Paste the private key to access the test funds.

> **⚠️ Security Note:** These private keys are public and generated by Hardhat for testing only. **Never** send real Mainnet ETH to these accounts.
